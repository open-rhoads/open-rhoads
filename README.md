## Hey, I'm Mikaela 👋
⚒️ I'm working on updating my personal portfolio and re-designing the Home and Library sections of the San Diego Mesa College website.<br />
📚 I'm currently learning more about data structure efficiency.<br />

💥 Fun Fact: In my very first job at a sandwich shop, I briefly danced in a full suit pickle costume on the street to advertise for them.<br />
